"""
validation.py — grammar and topology validation (URS FR 2.0, FR 2.2, NFR 3.1).

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
Given a normalized DisassemblyGraph, it checks the AND/OR-graph grammar and
topology required by FR 2.0 (single root, valid node types, role-consistent
connections, and topological anomalies: cycles, multiple roots, orphans) and
returns a flat list of point-by-point findings (FR 2.2 / NFR 1.1): each finding
names the exact node id(s) affected and explains why.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
It never blocks. Per FR 2.3 the user may always proceed despite warnings, so
validation only *reports*; it raises nothing. (The un-parsable-input case is
handled earlier, in the adapter, with UnparsableModelError — by the time a
graph reaches here, it exists and can be inspected.) It also does not fix or
mutate the graph (NFR 2.1).

DESIGN: EXTENSIBLE RULE ENGINE (NFR 3.1)
----------------------------------------
A validation rule is a function with a uniform signature:

    def rule_x(graph: DisassemblyGraph) -> list[ValidationWarning]

The engine (`validate`) simply iterates an explicit list of rules and
concatenates their findings. Adding a rule = write a function + add one line to
ALL_RULES.

Why an explicit list and NOT a self-registering @rule decorator: a decorator
that auto-collects rules into a global registry is more "magic" — to know which
rules run you must know a registry is populated at import time, and rule order
becomes implicit. An explicit list shows every active rule in one place, in a
controlled order, and is trivial to explain and test. A decorator pays off when
rules are many and spread across files; here they are eight in one module, so
the registry solves a problem we do not have. This is the "scalable but not
over-engineered" line the supervisor drew.

SEVERITY POLICY
---------------
Severity is FIXED per rule (each rule always emits the same severity), which
makes every rule predictable and testable. The single exception is
`rule_single_root`: it detects two conditions of genuinely different gravity
with one inspection — zero roots (ERROR: nowhere to start, implies a
total cycle/degenerate graph) vs. multiple roots (WARNING: several entry
points, a guide can still be produced from one). Splitting it into two rules
would inspect the same thing twice; varying severity *within* the rule is
cleaner. No rule takes severity as an external parameter — severities are
decided inside the rules.

    """
    Mass-balance check (URS FR 2.4): the sum of the LEAF component weights should
    equal the product (root) weight.

    THREE outcomes, because weights are often unknown (FR 4.0 explicitly allows
    this — Maria's components carry no weight at all), and a naive two-way check
    would fire false positives on every weightless model:

      1. NOT VERIFIABLE — the root has no weight, or any leaf lacks a weight, so
         the sum is incomplete. We cannot judge balance. Severity INFO: this is
         information ("balance not checkable, N weights missing"), not a model
         error. The vast majority of real graphs may land here.
      2. BALANCED — all weights present and the leaf sum matches the root within
         MASS_BALANCE_TOLERANCE. No finding.
      3. IMBALANCED — all weights present but the sum does NOT match. THIS is the
         real anomaly. Severity WARNING, reporting the two totals and the gap.

    "Verifiable" is strict: it requires the root weight AND every leaf weight to
    be present. A single missing leaf weight makes the sum incomplete (observed:
    Epson's root has a weight but its leaves do not -> not verifiable).

    Leaves are component nodes with no onward component/diamond (the final
    physical parts); intermediate composites are excluded, as including them
    would double-count mass.
