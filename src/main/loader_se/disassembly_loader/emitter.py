emitter.py — serialize a Guide into the IR JSON contract.

RESPONSIBILITY: turn the in-memory Guide into the JSON that the 7 generators
consume. This is the public boundary of the load phase, so the JSON SHAPE is a
contract: its schema is documented separately and versioned (schema_version).
The emitter does NOT compute anything about the disassembly — it receives a
finished Guide and writes it. Any logic here would be logic in the wrong place.

DESIGN CHOICES (all decided against the consumers' needs):

  - EXPLICIT NULLS. Optional fields with no value are emitted as `null`, never
    omitted. With 7 heterogeneous consumers (Python and JavaScript), a field
    that is sometimes present and sometimes absent is a source of bugs; a field
    that is always present (null or value) is predictable. So every optional
    field appears in every object.

  - STABLE FIELD ORDER & ensure_ascii. We build plain dicts in a fixed key order
    and serialize with ensure_ascii=True. ensure_ascii avoids any encoding
    surprise in downstream tools that mishandle UTF-8; stable order makes the
    output diffable in version control (a contract people review by eye).

  - IMAGE PATHS AS-IS. Images are passed as their path/URL exactly as the source
    gave them (FR 4.1), not embedded. Each image entry is tagged is_url so a
    consumer knows whether to fetch a remote URL (e.g. nespresso's http images)
    or load a local/relative path (Bialetti). We do not download or rewrite
    them — that keeps the load phase non-destructive and side-effect free.

We deliberately build dicts by hand rather than dataclasses.asdict(), because
asdict() would couple the JSON shape to the field names and nesting of the
dataclasses; an explicit mapping lets the internal models evolve without
silently changing the public contract.
