"""
linearizer.py — turn a normalized graph into an ordered list of Steps.

RESPONSIBILITY: walk the disassembly graph from its root and produce the flat,
ordered `Guide.steps`, applying the depth cut chosen by the user (FR 3.0). This
is the half of the load phase that encodes the disassembly grammar; validation
(validation.py) is the other half. The two are separate because they answer
different questions: validation asks "is this graph well-formed?", linearization
asks "in what order does one take it apart?".

THE GRAMMAR THIS ENCODES (confirmed empirically on Bialetti / Maria / Epson):
  - A diamond is a MACRO operation. Its ACTION children form a linear CHAIN
    (action_1 -> action_2 -> ...) describing HOW to perform it; the chain never
    branches and never mixes with components, so its order is purely topological.
  - A diamond's COMPONENT children are the RESULTS. At most ONE of them
    "continues" (leads onward to a further diamond); the rest are leaf outputs.
    Components are siblings with no topological order among them, so they are
    ordered by canvas geometry (x, then y) — the only ordering signal available.
  - Every diamond is reachable from the single root by following continuations.

TRAVERSAL ORDER: depth-first (DFS), one branch fully before the next. A
disassembly guide is executed one sub-system at a time, so DFS reads naturally;
breadth-first would interleave unrelated sub-systems step by step. (The URS says
"BFS with limited depth"; that phrase concerns the depth-CUT concept — stopping
at a level — not the order in which finished steps are listed. Depth is the
number of nested operations from the root, which we track with a counter
regardless of visitation order; we list steps branch-by-branch for readability.)

IMPLEMENTATION: an explicit stack, not recursion. This matches the cycle
detector in validation.py (one traversal technique across the package) and
cannot hit Python's recursion limit on a very deep model — the "survives the
course / reused by a later group" requirement makes deep inputs a real future
case, not a hypothetical. The cost is small and well-understood for a DFS.

NON-BLOCKING: like validation, linearization never raises on a malformed graph.
A cycle is broken by a visited-set; a missing piece yields a best-effort step.
The user may always proceed (FR 2.3).
