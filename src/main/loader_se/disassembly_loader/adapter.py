"""
adapter.py — format normalization.

RESPONSIBILITY (one sentence): take the raw JSON dict produced by the Builder
and return a canonical `DisassemblyGraph`, absorbing every format divergence,
WITHOUT judging whether the graph is valid.

This is the ONLY module that knows different input formats exist. It is
deliberately "dumb": it normalizes shape, it does not interpret meaning. It
does not decide what a Composite is, it does not order anything, it does not
check the grammar. The less logic lives here, the less breaks when a 7th
teammate's format shows up.

WHAT "ABSORB DIVERGENCES" MEANS — confirmed empirically on all 5 real files:

  1. WHERE EDGES LIVE. Two mutually exclusive storage locations:
       - a populated `connections` array (Bialetti), or
       - shapes of type "arrow" carrying the edge (Maria, nespresso,
         capsule, washing_machine).
     The adapter reads whichever is populated. If both are populated (never
     seen yet, but possible), it reads `connections` and records that the file
     is unusual — but note: the adapter does not emit ValidationWarnings (that
     is the validator's job). It simply will not crash.

  2. EDGE FIELD NAMES. `from_id`/`to_id` (Bialetti) vs
     `from_shape_id`/`to_shape_id` (the arrow-based files). Both collapse to
     Edge.src / Edge.dst. After the adapter, no other module knows these two
     namings ever existed.

  3. WEIGHT TYPE. `int` in Bialetti, `str` in the others. The adapter does NOT
     normalize this — it keeps `weight` as given (stringified for storage in
     GraphNode, which models weight as an optional string). The loader parses it
     to a number only at the IR level, where it is needed. Keeping the graph
     layer a faithful mirror of input is the point.

WHAT THE ADAPTER MAY RAISE: only `UnparsableModelError`, and only when there is
no graph to build at all — the JSON did not parse, `shapes` is missing or not a
list, a shape is not an object, a node shape has no `id`, or an edge entry
(connection / arrow) lacks an endpoint. Every *graph-level* defect (cycle,
dangling edge, unknown node type, multiple roots) is left intact in the returned
graph for the validator to find and report. The adapter never decides "this
graph is too broken to return".

DESIGN NOTE — why a function, not a class hierarchy:
We have two input shapes and a handful of `if` branches. A `normalize(raw) ->
DisassemblyGraph` function with clear branches is more readable than an
AbstractAdapter with MariaAdapter/BialettiAdapter subclasses. IF the formats
ever grow to many with genuinely divergent logic, THEN refactor toward a
strategy — when the pain is real, not in anticipation. This honours the
"scalable but not over-engineered" guidance.
