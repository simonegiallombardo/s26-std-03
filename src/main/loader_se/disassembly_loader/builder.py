builder.py — orchestration of the load pipeline into a complete Guide.

This module ties the three stages together into the in-memory result:

    raw JSON  --adapter-->  graph  --validate-->  warnings
                                   --linearize-->  steps
                                   --assemble--->  Guide

It is the single place that knows the ORDER of the pipeline. Keeping it separate
from the linearizer matters: the linearizer answers "in what order do we take it
apart?" and returns steps; the builder answers "what is the complete load
result?" and returns the Guide (product + steps + warnings + depth + optional
bill of materials). Different responsibilities, different modules.

The public entry points (build_guide / build_ir_file) live in the package
__init__; this module provides the function they call.

    Compute the leaf-only bill of materials from the linearized steps.

    The BoM is the set of LEAF components — the final physical parts — NOT the

    sum to exactly the product weight (2500 g); including the 6 intermediate
    composites (the chassis as it is progressively stripped) would double-count
    mass and break the mass balance (FR 2.4). Intermediate composites are
    transition states, not distinct line items.

    Concretely: every output across all steps is a leaf (the linearizer puts the
    single continuing composite in `continues_as`, not in `outputs`). A kept-whole
    block (depth cut) is also a leaf for BoM purposes — it is a final part the
    user chose not to open. So the BoM is simply the union of all step outputs,
