"""
models.py — the data vocabulary of the Disassembly Wizard load phase.

This module defines *only* data structures, no logic. It is the shared
vocabulary that every other module (adapter, loader, emitter) and every
downstream generator (PDF, TXT, MD, HTML, PPTX, DOCX, VIDEO) speaks.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND WHY IT IS SPLIT IN TWO LEVELS
------------------------------------------------------
There are two independent axes along which these structures change:

  1. The INPUT format (the Builder's JSON) can change: a new field, a new
     convention from a teammate's graph. This affects the GRAPH-LEVEL objects.
  2. The OUTPUT contract (what the 7 generators consume) can change: a
     teammate asks for one more field in a step. This affects the IR-LEVEL
     objects.

These two axes move independently — we have already observed the input axis
move twice (edges stored as `arrow` shapes vs. a `connections` array;
`from_shape_id`/`to_shape_id` vs. `from_id`/`to_id`). Keeping graph objects and
IR objects separate means a change on one axis never forces a change on the
other. This is the Single Responsibility Principle applied because the two
responsibilities genuinely exist here, not for doctrine.

A second reason: the GRAPH level must be able to represent *invalid* graphs
(a cycle, an action node with 4 children, a dangling edge), because we must
first represent a broken graph in order to validate and report it. The IR
level, by contrast, represents *only* well-formed, linearized guides — once
you hold a `Step`, it is correct by construction. Mixing the two would force
`Step` to also model malformation, losing that guarantee.

IMMUTABILITY (frozen dataclasses)
---------------------------------
Every object here is `frozen=True`. The rule we follow: freeze when the object
is born complete. All of these are constructed fully in one shot (the adapter
builds each GraphNode complete; the loader builds each Step complete), so
freezing costs nothing in construction verbosity and buys us safety — 7
downstream consumers receive these objects (or their JSON dump) and none of
them can mutate a guide by accident. This also honours NFR 2.1 (no destructive
operations on the model).

NOTE ON frozen + collections: `frozen=True` makes the *field binding*
immutable, not the object it points to. A frozen dataclass with a `list` field
still allows `obj.mylist.append(...)`. To get real immutability for
collections we use `tuple`, not `list`, for every multi-value field in the IR
objects. This is a deliberate choice, not an oversight.

    The boundary (decided against URS FR 2.0/2.2/2.3): if we can build a graph,
    any defect in it (cycle, multiple roots, orphan node, action-as-hub, even an
    edge pointing to a non-existent id) is a *validation warning* — never an
    exception — because FR 2.3 grants the user the right to proceed despite
    validation warnings. An exception is reserved for the case where there is no
    graph to validate in the first place:
      - the JSON is syntactically corrupt and does not parse;
      - the top-level `shapes` key is missing;
      - `shapes` is present but is not a list.

    Rule of thumb: "if I can construct a graph, every defect is a warning;
    if I cannot even construct it, that is an UnparsableModelError."

class GraphNode:
    """
    One node of the disassembly graph, AFTER the adapter has normalized it.

    A single class with a `type` field, not one subclass per role. During
    parsing a node is just "a shape with a type"; splitting roles into
    subclasses here would complicate the adapter (it would have to decide the
    subclass while reading) with no benefit, because the loader dispatches on
    `type` anyway. Role-specific *meaning* is applied later, at the IR level.

    WHY WE KEEP COORDINATES (x, y)
    ------------------------------
    The IR we hand to teammates does NOT carry coordinates — there the step
    order is already resolved. But the loader *internally* needs them in one
    real case: when a node fans out to several children that are siblings (e.g.
    nespresso's action id=2 has 4 component children), the edges tell us "these
    4 are children" but give no order among them. The only residual ordering
    signal is geometry: left-to-right / top-to-bottom (x, then y). Observed in
    nespresso: Water Tank x=100, Drip Tray x=300, Capsule Bin x=500, Main
    Housing x=700 — ascending x yields the natural reading order. If we dropped
    coordinates in the adapter (which runs BEFORE the loader), the loader could
    no longer disambiguate. So coordinates live at the graph level and are
    dropped only when building the IR.

    WHY THE `extra` DICT
    --------------------
    Teammate formats already diverge, and FR 11.0 / NFR 2.0 call for future
    extensibility and interoperability. Any source field we don't explicitly
    model is preserved in `extra` rather than discarded, so a future format with
    a new attribute loses no information and does not break parsing. Costs one
    field; protects against silently dropping a field that turns out to matter
    downstream.

    Fields:
      id          : the node id from the source JSON (authoritative key).
      type        : the normalized NodeType.
      text        : the label/description shown to the operator. Treated as an
                    OPAQUE string — we never parse meaning out of it. (Confirmed
                    empirically: ordering lives in topology/geometry, not in
                    label text.)
      x, y        : canvas coordinates; loader-only, used to order sibling
                    fan-outs. May be None if a source omits them.
      weight      : nominal weight as given by the source. Kept as the raw
                    string here (sources store it as a string, sometimes ""),
                    parsed to a number only at the IR level where it is needed,
                    so the graph layer stays a faithful, lossless mirror of input.
      weight_unit : unit string (e.g. "g").
      material    : material identifier/name if present (component attribute we
                    DO need — feeds FR 4.0 material info downstream).
      color       : colour identifier if present (component attribute, FR 4.0).
      image_path  : path or URL to the node's image (FR 4.1). Kept as-is; not
                    embedded. The emitter decides path-vs-URL handling.
      tools       : the tools string as given by the source, on actions AND on
                    diamonds. First-class (not `extra`) because the IR contract
                    consumes it: actions carry individual tools; diamonds carry
                    a comma-separated aggregate, which is the ONLY tool source

class Guide:
    """
    The complete in-memory result of the load phase — what the emitter
    serializes to the IR JSON and what the 7 generators consume.

    SCHEMA INVARIANCE UNDER DEPTH: the *shape* of a Guide does not depend on the
    chosen DepthSpec; only its *content* (how many steps) does. full disassembly
    yields more steps, "keep main assemblies" yields fewer, but every Step has
    the same schema. Generators know nothing about depth — they receive an
    ordered list of steps. (This invariant is worth a dedicated test.)

    Fields:
      product       : the Root component (the whole product being disassembled).
      steps         : the ordered list of disassembly steps. A tuple (immutable);
                      order IS the execution order.
      warnings      : all validation findings (FR 2.0/2.2). Carried WITH the
                      guide, not raised, so the user can inspect them and still
                      proceed (FR 2.3). A tuple (immutable).
      depth         : the DepthSpec actually applied, recorded for provenance so
                      a consumer/report knows how this guide was cut.
      schema_version : version of the IR contract. Bumped only when the IR schema
                      changes, so the 7 consumers can detect an incompatible
                      guide. Frozen-early discipline + this field together protect
                      the downstream contract.
      tools         : union of tools_required across every step, deduplicated
                      case-insensitively, in first-appearance order. Added in
                      schema 1.1 for FR 1.3 (show the tools needed for the whole
                      disassembly at the top of the guide): computed once here
                      instead of 7 times in 7 generators.
      bill_of_materials : LEAF-ONLY tuple of the final extracted parts (including
                      kept-whole blocks under a depth cut), deduplicated by
                      node_id — intermediate composites are transition states and
                      would double-count mass (FR 2.4 spirit). None when not
                      requested (include_bom=False), emitted as null; an empty
                      tuple means "requested, and there are no parts". Serves
                      FR 1.3 (BoM at the top) and FR 9.1 (structured BoM export).
